I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Colorado Anschutz Department of Biostatistics and Informatics.
Prior to joining CU, I obtained both my master and PhD from University of Louisville under Drs. Riten Mitra and Maiying Kong.

My research interests are Bayesian survival models, stochastic process and Markov chain.

Stay tuned for my upcoming papers and talks...
